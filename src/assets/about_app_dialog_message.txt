Build notes:
\n
The application has been tested in the Android emulator and on 2 other Android devices.  
Performance does appear to vary across devices.  
When opening a log file from the log manager, larger than 300KB, 
it may take several seconds to finish loading the scroll 
view once the progress dialog has closed.  
It is recommended that you clear the screen first prior to moving 
between sub activities, so as to alleviate the work load on the 
UI thread once the main activity resumes.
